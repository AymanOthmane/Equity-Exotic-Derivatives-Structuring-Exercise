# Equity-Exotic-Derivatives-Structuring-Exercise
Please find below the code proposed in the py file(GS\_Coding\_Exercise.py) present in the GitHub link attached to my email.\\
For further clarity and practicality, i took the liberty of adding a streamlit interface(user\_interface.py) with a tool\_box.py file to accompany it. This interface, as shown in the figure 1 and 2, allows interaction with the clients data in the first page, and observing the aggregated output and it's graphic illustration in the second.\\
To launch the Streamlit interface, please double-click the Libraries.bat file to ensure all required libraries are installed. Then, double-click the Interface.bat file, which will open the interface in your default web browser. Alternatively, you can launch the interface directly from your Python terminal using the following command: \\
python -m streamlit run user\_interface.py
